// Closure is a mechanism that 
helps us access a given value outside of a function 
and when that function is no longer active.
// Closure - the variable exists in another function,
although the function in 
which the variable was created is no longer active.
 // In program memory, a variable exists if it is referenced 
 by a reference from 
 another function. We can access it, but also change it.
