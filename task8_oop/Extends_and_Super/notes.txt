>>Inheritance is the sharing of functionality between classes.
>>Extending classes prevents the creation of duplicate code
>>In an instance where the subclass doesn't have a method that's 
  defined in the parent class, the subclass will use that in the
  parent class. Otherwise, the method provided in the subclass will
  be first in line for use even if it has the same name as the 
  one in the parent class.
>>Super is a reference to the super class.
  Use super when trying to reference the properties from the 
  parent class constructor without having to rewrite the code.
