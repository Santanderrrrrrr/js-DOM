//In the wallet constructor, the wallet has it's value declared in the
  scope of the construction in order to keep it encapsulated using closures.

  The getWalletValue is declared in the constructor using this in order
  allow external access and this is done in the constructor scope 
  because only then can the getWalletValue method access the wallet
  value.

//The static keyword defines a static method or property for a 
  class, or a class static initialization block. Neither static 
  methods nor static properties can be called on instances of 
  the class. Instead, they're called on the class itself.
